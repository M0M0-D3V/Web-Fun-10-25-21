### Tips:
- Test your code frequently by opening it in the browser! When building the HTML/CSS, start from outside-to-inside and top-to-bottom. 1 row or column at a time, make the HTML and CSS and check for accuracy before moving on to the next row or column
- Done with assignments but not sure if you're ready for exam? Try it anyway and it will be the best guide to tell what you need to focus on if you need another attempt
