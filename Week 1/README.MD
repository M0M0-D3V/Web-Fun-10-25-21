### Tips:
- Everything we learn each day builds on the prior day's learning.
- Don't worry about memorizing everything-- Focus on the "why" and "how" something works. So even if you do forget, and you will-- you can Google it because you understand the "why" and "how"
- Remember the 20 minute rule - It is there to help you when you are stuck and not sure what to do. Also when you realize you have been trying to solve for an hour and are getting nowhere fast.
