### Tips:
- Remember 20 minute rule
- **Better Questions -> Better Answers** - Asking for help is great! It is useful and especially helpful in your path to growing as a developer because it forces you to communicate what your code is doing to get another person to understand. You will continue to practice this skill as you go into your first full stack!
  - Help speed up the process by including what you are working on as well as what particular aspect is stumping you.
    - Saying `"I'm working on Flex Nav Bar and I can't get the links to go right and the logo to left. I've tried display: flex; and justify-content: space-between; on the nav div and body but it's not working. Am I missing something?"` and `including a screenshot of what you're working on` will often get you further than just asking "I'm working on Flex Nav Bar and I'm stuck."
